It also requires maintaining and supporting the cybersecurity of the Kingdom in order to protect its vital interests, national security, critical infrastructures, high priority sectors and governmental services and practices. To accomplish this objective, the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) was established, and its mandate was approved as per the Royal Decree number 6801, dated 11/2/1439H making it the national and specialized reference for matters related to cybersecurity in the Kingdom. NCA’s mandates and duties fulfill the strategic and regulatory cybersecurity needs related to the development of cybersecurity national policies, governance mechanisms, frameworks, standards, controls and guidelines. They also fulfill the need to continuously monitor the compliance of organizations to support the important role of cybersecurity which has increased with the rise of security risks in cyberspace more than any time before. NCA’s mandate states that its responsibility for cybersecurity does not absolve any public, private or other organization from its own cybersecurity responsibilities as confirmed by the Royal Decree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439H, which states that “all government organizations must improve their cybersecurity level to protect their networks, systems and data, and comply with NCA’s policies, framework, standards, controls and guidelines” From this perspective, NCA developed the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC-1: 2018) to set the minimum cybersecurity requirements for national organizations that are within its scope of ECC implementation. This document highlights the details of these controls, goals, scope, statement of applicability, compliance approach and monitoring. All national organizations must implement all necessary measures to ensure continuous compliance with the ECC as per item 3 of article 10 of NCA’s mandate and as per the Royal Decree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439H."

The NCA strongly encourages all other organizations in the Kingdom to leverage these controls to implement best practices to improve and enhance their cybersecurity. ECC Statement of Applicability These controls have been developed after taking into consideration the cybersecurity needs of all organizations and sectors in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Every organization must comply with all applicable controls in this document. Applicability to implement these cybersecurity controls depends on the organization’s business and its use of certain technologies. For example: • Controls in subdomain 4-2 (Cloud Computing and Hosting Cybersecurity) are applicable and must be implemented by organizations currently using or planning to use cloud computing and hosting services. • Controls in main domain 5 (Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity) are applicable and must be implemented by organizations currently using or planning to use industrial control systems."

The term is often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring where physical security is needed.Closed-Circuit Television CCTV A model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable IT capabilities/resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal operation management effort or service provider interaction. It allows users to access technology-based services from the cloud without knowledge of, expertise with, or control over the technology infrastructure that supports them. The cloud computing model is composed of five essential characteristics: on-demand self-service, ubiquitous network access, location independent resource pooling, rapid elasticity and measured service. There are three types of cloud computing services delivery models: Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS), Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS); Based on the enterprise access for cloud computing, there are four models: Private Cloud, Community Cloud, Public Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud.Cloud Computing Disclosure of or obtaining information by unauthorized persons, which are unauthorized to be leaked or obtained, or violation of the cybersecurity policy of the organization through disclosure, change, sabotage or loss of anything, either intentionally or unintentionally. The expression “compromise” means disclosure of, obtaining, leaking, altering or use of sensitive data without authorization (including cryptographic keys and other critical cybersecurity standards).Compromise Organizational information (or data) that is considered highly critical and sensitive as per the organization’s data classification, which it has prepared to be used by the organization itself or other specific organizations. One way to determine the classification of such type of information/data is through assessing the impact from unauthorized disclosure, access, loss or damage. Impacts could be financial or reputational on the organization or customers, impact on the lives of people related to the disclosed information, impact and harm on the national security, economy or capabilities. Confidential Data/Information includes all information that if disclosed, lost or damaged in an unauthorized manner, there would be legal consequences. Confidential Data/ Information Maintaining authorized restrictions on access to and disclosure of information, including means of protecting privacy/personal information.Confidentiality These are the assets (i.e., facilities, systems, networks, processes, and key operators who operate and process them), whose loss or vulnerability to security breaches may result in: • Significant negative impact on the availability, integration or delivery of basic services, including services that could result in serious loss of property and/or lives and/or injuries, alongside observance of significant economic and/or social impacts. • Significant impact on national security and/or national defense and/or state economy or national capacities.Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)"

    "text": "Sharing Indicator: White Document Classification: Unclassified 35 Essential Cybersecurity Controls Definition Terminology The length of time that information, data, event logs or backups must be retained, regardless of the form (i.e., paper and electronic).Retention A practice for the development of computer software and applications in a way that protects against the exposure to cybersecurity vulnerabilities related to software and applications.Secure Coding Standards Protecting, hardening and configuring the settings of computers, systems, applications, network devices and security devices for resisting cyber-attacks, such as: stopping or changing factory and default accounts, stopping of unused services and unused network ports.Secure Configuration and Hardening A system that manages and analyzes security events logs in real time in order to provide monitoring of threats, analysis of the results of interrelated rules for event logs and reports on logs data, and incident response.Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) A process intended to ensure that modified or new systems and applications include appropriate security controls and protection and do not introduce any security holes or vulnerabilities that might compromise other systems or applications or misuses of the system, application or its information, and to maintain functionality as intended.Security Testing A methodology to systems and software development and networks design that seeks to make systems, software and networks free from cybersecurity vulnerabilities/weaknesses and impervious to cyber-attack as much as possible through measures such as: continuous testing, authentication safeguards and adherence to best programming and design practices.Security-by- Design A method to validate that the email server used in the sender’s email address actually belongs to the sender’s organization email domain.Sender Policy Framework Key principle in cybersecurity that aims at minimizing errors and fraud when processing specific tasks. It is accomplished through having several people with different privileges, required to complete a task.Segregation of Duties Any organization acting as a party in a contractual relationship to provide goods or services (this includes suppliers and service providers).Third-Party Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, or individuals through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. Also, the potential for a threat-source to successfully exploit a particular information system vulnerability.Threat It provides organized information and analysis of recent, current and potential attacks that could pose a cyber threat to the organization.Threat Intelligence Any type of weakness in a computer system, software, application, set of procedures, or in anything that leaves cybersecurity exposed to a threat.Vulnerability It analyzes, filters, monitors, and blocks Internet traffic to and from a web application. It is also able to filter the content of specific web applications. Web Application Firewall Malware that is unknown before, produced/disseminated recently, and normally hard to detect by signature-based protection anti-malware applications. Zero-Day Malware"
